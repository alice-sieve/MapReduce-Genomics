# Summary

Genomics datasets are huge and booming research area. Where Genomics is
mostly research and studied for resarching on possible disease in humans there is
a lot less work done in direction of mutation and structual genomics based on humans.
We study the implementation of 1000 genomes datasets in geographical regions of
structural, functional, comparative and mutation genomics datasets and present an
approach on how the datasets can be studied using map reduce framework. We form
clusters of genomics dataset on map reduce and show the similarities found in humans
genomics datasets on the behavior in regions. The map extracts all sets of genomics
datasets and implements on all regions, the reduce phase results in a study of similarities
between human behavior and genomics datasets similarity. We challenge the assumption
that the birth place or region affects the evolution of human and their perception
and analyzing human beings. We suggest that it is more dependent on what nearby
genomics datasets the humans spend their day-to-day activities. We show graphica representations
and the reduce phase gives us a 3D visualisation of multi region, multi genomics implementation. This publish is largely a intialisation step where we explore and prove how genomics can be research using Map Reduce.
